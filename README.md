FilesFromYou is transforming the file sharing business by making it super easy to share files
between your friends and family. You share files by installing a small client on your home PC or mobile
device. In one of the latest releases, it has turned out that some clients have very high CPU usage,
making the FilesFromYou service unusable.

In order to find out what is going wrong we want you to design a service that handles CPU data
reported to our backend. The collected data should be processed and aggregated in an intuitive way
such that it helps troubleshooting which clients are having a problem with the CPU usage. Service is
responsible for generating the report on the data.
